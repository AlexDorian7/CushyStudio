# Intro Guide For Tinkerers

`üõãÔ∏è CushyStudio` comes packed with feature to allow you to create your own AI-powered image and video creation tools.

In Cushy, tools are called `Actions`.

Creating actions is easy because `üõãÔ∏è CushyStudio`

1. on startup, ensure `CushyStudio` is connected to some `ComfyUI` server

    - a whole `typescript SDK` will be generated in the `schema/` folder
    - All your custom nodes, models, images will be converted to `enums`, `classes`, `helpers`, etc allowing you to create actions with maximum type safety and completion.

1. create a folder in the `actions/` subfolder at the root
1. create any `myaction.ts` file inside this folder
1. open the whole CushyStudio repository in `vscode`

    - üëâ open the whole CushyStudio installed repository
    - NOT just the action folder, NOR the action file itself, but

1. initialize your action from some basic code or generated code from existing workflows

    ```ts
    action('demo1-basic', {
        author: 'rvion',
        // A. define the UI
        ui: (form) => ({
            positive: form.str({ label: 'Positive', default: 'flower' }),
        }),
        // B. defined the execution logic
        run: async (action, form) => {
            //  build a ComfyUI graph
            const graph = action.nodes
            const ckpt = graph.CheckpointLoaderSimple({ ckpt_name: 'albedobaseXL_v02.safetensors' })
            const seed = action.randomSeed()
            const sampler = graph.KSampler({
                seed: seed,
                steps: 20,
                cfg: 14,
                sampler_name: 'euler',
                scheduler: 'normal',
                denoise: 0.8,
                model: ckpt,
                positive: graph.CLIPTextEncode({ text: form.positive, clip: ckpt }),
                negative: graph.CLIPTextEncode({ text: '', clip: ckpt }),
                latent_image: graph.EmptyLatentImage({ width: 512, height: 512, batch_size: 1 }),
            })

            graph.SaveImage({
                images: graph.VAEDecode({ samples: sampler, vae: ckpt }),
                filename_prefix: 'ComfyUI',
            })

            // run the graph you built
            await action.PROMPT()
        },
    })
    ```

1. see how actions look like by dropping any ComfyUI `workflow` or `image` into the action and looking at the conver

An Action is a file containing

-   A UI definition (widgets, form, styles, default values, tabs, etc...) (a bit like gradio in python)
-   A piece of code that runs your action
-   ... more stuff

## Publish your Action pack

Publishing your action is easy !

1.  Create a github repository. (https://github.com/new)

    ![](docs/static/img/screenshots/2023-10-18-23-15-11.png)

2.  Commit your actions files (follow instructions given by github on the new repository page).

3.  Open an issue asking to add your `action pack` to the `marketplace`.

## Work with remote ComfyUI as if they were local

-   automatically download images in your local outputs folder
-   automatically upload files

## Switch between ComfyUI remotes like you would

-   ‚úÖ quickly switch between various ComfyUI setups
-   ‚è≥ parallelize work across multiple instances

edit the list of ComfyUI setups in `CONFIG.json`

## ComfyUI compatible: convert workflow to Action.

`üõãÔ∏è CushyStudio` is directly compatible with `ComfyUI` workflow json format and images. Add them to the action folder to quickly use them inside Cushy.

## Built-in full-featured Image editor

Layers, efects, masks, blending modes, ...and more. Always one click away

## 3. create your own Actions to streamline any image or video production

1. define your own UI
2. build one or many prompts with custom logic in typescript
3. type-safe experience pushed to the MAXIMUM
    1. every single value / enum is typed
    2. a built-in standard library made to quickly build your dream workflow
    3. use lambda to get completion only for the node that produce value needed
