I first need
- one-click create action pack
- proper action pack manifest file
- better default action pack files  (that shows how to build modular ui helper, etc)
- support assets in action packs
- polish some widgets
    - choices
    - lists (re-ordering, ...)
    - image loader (local files by path)
    - ...
- better default layout on first run
- minor cleanup here and there
- add CLA for contributors,
- code builder:
   - select nodes  => see the corresponding code in realtime
    - have a better auto-UI generated
    - new primitive to add all the primitive inputs instead of having super long names,
- fix prompt (-api.json) import
- fix png import
