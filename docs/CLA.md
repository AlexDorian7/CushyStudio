# Frequently Asked Questions :

_(or rather questions I expect people to ask often)_

---

### Q. Will `CushyStudio` remain open source?

### A. Yes.

`CushyStudio` is, and always will be 100% open source and free to use as a tool. Make assets with the app. Use those assets in your games or products; make art, etc. I don't own your work, nor want to. I want to help you create it, help you promote it, and have fun in the process.

ðŸš¨ ðŸ‘‰ Its AGPL license just say that you **can not EMBED** CushyStudio engine in a commercial project without a license. Nor you can re-sell it, nor use it on some closed-source backend server of your project. Unless you want to support my work, and buy a GPL license for a fair price.

---

### Q. Will you create a paid version of `CushyStudio`?

### A. No. Again, `CushyStudio` will always be free and open source.

I will not create a paid version of `CushyStudio`. I will not introduce limitations in the free version that you have to pay to unlock. It is to everyone's benefit that `CushyStudio` remains free and open source, including me.

What I want to do, is:

-   offer GPU cloud services for `CushyStudio` users who do not own a powerful GPU locally, so they can run any actions they want very easilly.

-   Allow you to get paid for your actions, both by allowing you to handle access to your actions your way, and by enabling revenue sharing on the cloud GPU services users will rent to run your free actions.

I hope that these services will fund the future development of `CushyStudio`.

### Q. it's AGPL - Do you accept contributions like bug fixes ?

### A. yes, that's why I have a CLA

This CLA only concern your contribution to the main repository, (not your actions !). It allows me to relicense the patches you submit in the main repo so I can still sell those GPL licenses to companies looking to embed CushyStudio, and still use the whole CushyStudio engine in the backend to provide those extra cloud features and support the continued development of `CushyStudio`.

I can obviously already do this with the code I wrote myself, but the CLA allows me to do it with those fixes you contribute for the community too. I feel this is really fair.

---

### Q. Does this concern `User submitted action packs` ?

### A. No; your actions are yours !

Pick any license you want. Do what you want with them, they are yours. I don't want to steal your work, quite the opposite! I want to build the platform to let you express yourselves, publish your work, and even get paid for it.

---

### Q. How does the CLA benefit the community?

### A. Depends who you ask ðŸ˜„

The CLA enables me:

-   to release `CushyStudio` on platforms that I wouldn't otherwise be able to release on, such as within Apple's App Store.

-   to dual-license certain parts of the code under a permissive license in order to create an open standard that is usable across all SD applications.

-   to fund the project though selling licenses to some companies that would want to embed `CushyStudio` in their products.

---

### Q. What if I want to contribute something like a bug-fix but I don't want to sign the CLA?

A. Unfortunately, signing the CLA is a necessary requirement if you want to contribute to the `CushyStudio` project. If I allow code into `CushyStudio` that is not covered by the CLA, I would be opening myselve up to the possibility of being blocked from distributing `CushyStudio` on other platforms (eg: Apple) or from launching a cloud service to rent GPUs version.

---

### Q. What does this mean for `CushyStudio`'s development?

A. The CLA provides a way for me to fund the future development of `CushyStudio` without me having to charge for `CushyStudio` itself. As a result of this, `CushyStudio`'s development will happen faster and the quality of the user experience will be better, yet the program will remain open source and completely free for all users.

If this project ever becomes successfull, it will allow me to bring in people with the right skills to make `CushyStudio` the best generative art program in the world, and not just the best free program either!

---

### Q. Is a CLA against the spirit of the GPL ?

### A. No. Apache, Django, Joomla, OpenJS, Python and QT all have CLAs

CLAs are not uncommon in free and open source software (FOSS). Apache, Django, Joomla, OpenJS, Python and QT all have CLAs. The Free Software Foundation (authors of the GPL) ask their contributors to assign copyright to the FSF or disclaim copyright entirely, which is more than I am asking for in `CushyStudio`'s CLA. Under this CLA, contributors retain copyright to their code and are free to use it however they like.

---

### Q. I have already submitted code that is waiting to be merged. What should I do now?

### A. Jus tadd you name in CLA-signatures.txt file

If you have already submitted code that is waiting to be merged, please add your name to the CLA-signatures.txt file in the `CushyStudio` repository. This will allow me to merge your code into `CushyStudio` without any further delay.

# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `CushyStudio` code. This page describes the established guidelines for contributions of code, patches and artwork to `CushyStudio`.

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, `CushyStudio` must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to certain license terms. This license is not only for the protection of the contributors themselves, but also for the protection of the project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

All past and future contributors of non-trivial amounts of code (more than just a line or two) to `CushyStudio` are required to sign the CLA. If somebody is unable to sign the document, their contribution will not be accepted or will be removed from `CushyStudio`.

Version 1.0 â€“ 2023-10-24
