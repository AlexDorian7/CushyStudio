# Frequently Asked Questions :

_(or rather questions I expect people to ask often)_

---

### Q. Will `CushyStudio` remain open source and free ?

### A. Yes. and Yes.

`CushyStudio` is, and always will be 100% open source and free to use as a tool. Make assets with the app. Use those assets in your games or products; make art, etc. I don't own your work, nor want to. I want to help you create it, help you promote it, and have fun in the process.

Its AGPL license just say that you **can not EMBED** CushyStudio engine in a commercial project without a license. Nor you can re-sell it, nor use it on some closed-source backend server of your project. Unless you want to support my work, and buy a GPL license for a fair price.

---

### Q. Why did you pick AGPL instead of GPLV3 then.

#### Cushy is TEMPORARILLY AGPL onlyÂ (I'll switch to GPLV3 later); also, it is a tool so you can use any assets you make with it in any way without any problem.

-   Due to the fact CushyStudio is a tool, AGPL is not that restrictive. I'm not forcing you to open source your project just because you used CushyStudio to make some assets. the tool is free to use, your assets are yours.

-   I picked AGPL because I don't want to work for some other cloud company to suddenly start offering Cushy actions in the cloud and make money of me while I still can't provide as I want for my family. I want to be able to make some money with CushyStudio in a community friendly way.

-   Once I'll have made enough to provide my family (haven't decided yet how much that is, but will be public soon), I'll switch CushyStudio to a fully free GPL v3 license. ðŸš¨ My goal is to state a clear goal for full GPL v3 release as soon as possible and be 100% transparent on all earnings I make. Any big company will have the opportunity to pay once for everyone to have access to CushyStudio in a full GPLV3 way. (ðŸ‘‹ feel free to contact me anytime)

### Q. SO.. Will you create a paid version of `CushyStudio`?

### A. No. Again, `CushyStudio` will always be free and open source.

I will not create a paid version of `CushyStudio`. I will not introduce feature limitations in the free version that you have to pay to unlock. It is to everyone's benefit that `CushyStudio` remains free and open source, including me.

What I want to do, is:

-   Offer GPU cloud services for `CushyStudio` users who do not own a powerful GPU locally, so they can run any actions they want very easilly.

-   Build a system for sharing revenue with and/or driving donations to action creators.

-   and Possibly sell permissive licenses to companies that would want to embed `CushyStudio` engine (SDK) in their products for real-time generation, or backend usage in private commercial products.

I hope that these services will fund the future development of `CushyStudio`.

### Q. Okay, so for now, CushyStudio license is AGPL - Do you accept contributions like bug fixes to the core engine ?

### A. yes, that's part of the reason why I have a CLA

This CLA only concern your contribution to the main repository, (not your actions !). It allows me to relicense the patches you submit in the main repo so I can still sell those GPL licenses to companies looking to embed CushyStudio, and still use the whole CushyStudio engine in the backend to provide those extra cloud features and support the continued development of `CushyStudio`.

I can obviously already do this with the code I wrote myself, but the CLA allows me to do it with those fixes you contribute for the community too. I feel this is really fair.

---

### Q. Does the CLA concern `User-published action packs in the marketplace` ?

### A. No; your actions are yours.

Pick any license you want. Do what you want with them, they are yours. I don't want to steal your work, quite the opposite! I want to build the platform to let you express yourselves, publish your work, and even get paid for it.

---

### Q. What if I want to contribute something like a bug-fix but I don't want to sign the CLA?

### A. Unfortunately, signing the CLA is a necessary requirement

if you want to contribute to the `CushyStudio` project. If I allow code into `CushyStudio` that is not covered by the CLA, I would be opening myselve up to the possibility of being blocked from distributing `CushyStudio` on other platforms (eg: Apple) or from launching a cloud service to rent GPUs version.

---

### Q. Is a CLA against the spirit of the GPL ?

### A. No. Apache, Django, Joomla, OpenJS, Python and QT all have CLAs

CLAs are not uncommon in free and open source software (FOSS). Apache, Django, Joomla, OpenJS, Python and QT all have CLAs. The Free Software Foundation (authors of the GPL) ask their contributors to assign copyright to the FSF or disclaim copyright entirely, which is more than I am asking for in `CushyStudio`'s CLA. Under this CLA, contributors retain copyright to their code and are free to use it however they like.

# Contributor License Agreement

(totaly inspired by some other CLA found online, hence the serious & legal tone)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `CushyStudio` code. This page describes the established guidelines for contributions of code, patches and artwork to `CushyStudio`.

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, `CushyStudio` must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to certain license terms. This license is not only for the protection of the contributors themselves, but also for the protection of the project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

All past and future contributors of non-trivial amounts of code (more than just a line or two) to `CushyStudio` are required to sign the CLA. If somebody is unable to sign the document, their contribution will not be accepted or will be removed from `CushyStudio`.

Version 1.0 â€“ 2023-10-24

You and `CushyStudio` agree:

You grant me, RÃ©mi Vion (rvion on github), the ability to use the Contributions in any way. You hereby grant to me, a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contribution and such derivative works.

You are able to grant me these rights. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for the Contributions.

The Contributions are your original work. You represent that the Contributions are Your original works of authorship, and to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or patent related to the Contributions. You also represent that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this license. For example, if you have signed an agreement requiring you to assign the intellectual property rights in the Contributions to an employer or customer, that would conflict with the terms of this license.

I determines the code that is in the project. You understand that the decision to include the Contribution in any project or source repository is entirely that of mine, and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions will be included in any product.

No Implied Warranties. I acknowledges that, except as explicitly described in this Agreement, the Contribution is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
