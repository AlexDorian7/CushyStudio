# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `CushyStudio` code.

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions to `CushyStudio` main repository from any person or entity, `CushyStudio` must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to certain license terms. This license is not only for the protection of the contributors themselves, but also for the protection of the project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

All past and future contributors of non-trivial amounts of code (more than just a line or two) to `CushyStudio` are required to sign the CLA. If somebody is unable to sign the document, their contribution will not be accepted or will be removed from `CushyStudio`.

Version 1.0 – 2023-10-24

You and `CushyStudio` agree:

You grant me, Rémi Vion (rvion on github), the ability to use the Contributions in any way. You hereby grant to me, a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contribution and such derivative works.

You are able to grant me these rights. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for the Contributions.

The Contributions are your original work. You represent that the Contributions are Your original works of authorship, and to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or patent related to the Contributions. You also represent that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this license. For example, if you have signed an agreement requiring you to assign the intellectual property rights in the Contributions to an employer or customer, that would conflict with the terms of this license.

I determines the code that is in the project. You understand that the decision to include the Contribution in any project or source repository is entirely that of mine, and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions will be included in any product.

No Implied Warranties. I acknowledges that, except as explicitly described in this Agreement, the Contribution is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
