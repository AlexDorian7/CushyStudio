## Contributor License Agreement

### Welcome to the `CushyStudio` Contributor Family!

First off, a big thank you for considering contributing to `CushyStudio`. Every contribution, big or small, enriches our community and gets us one step closer to our shared vision.

This Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is a little formality we need to go through to ensure the integrity of `CushyStudio` for everyone involved. Let's get through this together.

#### Why Do We Need This Agreement?

-   **For you**: It ensures your contributions are recognized and establishes clarity about how they can be used.
-   **For `CushyStudio` and its users**: It ensures that the rights around the contributed code are clear and prevent any potential hiccups down the road.
-   **For meÂ (rvion)**: It makes sure I can use your contributions in possible way, like providing cloud GPU services or other open-source-friendly services to sustain the project. Check the CLA summary below to know more, but don't worry. This project is free, open source, and I'll even switch it to GPLV3 at some point.

#### What's Expected from Our Contributors?

1. If you're contributing more than just a minor tweak (think more than a line or two), I'll need you to sign this CLA. It's a one-time thing.
2. If, for some reason, you can't sign this CLA, I might not be able to accept your contribution.

#### Our Agreement:

1. **Your Contribution**: By signing below, you're giving me, RÃ©mi Vion (aka rvion on Github), the green light to use your contributions however I see fit. In more formal terms, this means granting a perpetual, non-exclusive, global, and royalty-free license to use, modify, distribute, and build upon your work.

2. **You've Got the Power**: By signing, you're saying you're legally allowed to make this contribution. If someone else, like an employer, has rights to what you're contributing, please make sure they're okay with this before signing.

3. **Your Original Work**: Please ensure that what you're contributing is your original creation. If there's any doubt or potential conflict, let's talk.

4. **Inclusion in the Project**: Whether your contribution makes it to the final cut is up to me. But know this â€“ every contribution is valuable, and we appreciate your effort.

5. **No Hidden Strings Attached**: Unless explicitly stated here, your contribution comes as-is, with no warranties. That said, we trust and value the quality of contributions from our community.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

In case you want to know more about the CLA, here are some answers to questions you might have:
If your questions are not covered, you can take a look at the full FAQ: https://github.com/rvion/CushyStudio/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md

### Q: Will `CushyStudio` remain open source and free?

**A**: Absolutely! I'm committed to keeping `CushyStudio` 100% open source and free. Create assets, art, games â€“ you name it. It's your creation, and I'm just here to help you make it.

### Q: Why the AGPL and not the GPLV3?

**A**: For now, `CushyStudio` is under AGPL, because I want to drive the project how I see fit. I plan to switch it to GPLV3 down the line once, once I'll have make enough money through donations or cloud GPU renting services to buy a home. I've chosen this path to protect myself, the project and ensure its sustainable growth. Rest assured, using `CushyStudio` for asset creation won't bind you in any restrictive way. I just don't want other people to re-sell `CushyStudio` as a service without my consent or .

### Q: Any plans for a paid version of `CushyStudio`?

**A**: No, and that's a promise. `CushyStudio` will always be free and open source. While we do have plans to offer complementary services (like cloud GPU services or revenue-sharing systems), the core of `CushyStudio` will remain untouched and free for all.

Let's create something amazing together! ðŸ’ªðŸŽ‰
