wishlist

-   api to retrieve list of available embedding / or a way to include them in the comfy schemas
-   a way to send errors to the front via websocket so the front can properly show what's going wrong
-   a new prompt ID value in all WS payloads scoped to a prompt
-   some progress in @data it auto-installer, so I can just use this api to ensure all the demo workflows (a.k.a scripts, a.k.a. mini SD apps) in the demo library i'm building are self-contained and install missing deps on their own
