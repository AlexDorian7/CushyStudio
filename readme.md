## Architecture

`CushyStudio` is a cross-platform application built using the [Tauri](https://tauri.studio) framework. Tauri is based on the OS specific webview and Rust to work. Read about tauri [here](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/about/intro)

`CushyStudio` is a polygot application. `CushyStudio` relies on Rust api for file operations and TS, SCSS for the webview. Rust code are under `src-tauri` directory whereas the webview code are under `src` directory. The API that connects webview with the Rust code is under `src/Api` directory.

<!-- This project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project, maybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them. -->

<!-- ## Comfy Wishlist

-   [ ] `store` node for persistng node output across flow evaluation
-   [ ] `promptID` that can be sent to the server to be included in every `'status'` , `'progress'` , `'executing'` & `'executed'` update payloads -->
