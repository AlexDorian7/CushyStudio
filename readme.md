## Getting started

![](docs/images/2023-03-14_06-47-30.png)

## Installation

-   install https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI
-   download some models so you have a functional Comfy setup (see [this](scripts/download-models.sh))
-   start the server `python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0`
-   start the client `yarn dev`
-   open a web-browser with CORS disabled (e.g. `google-chrome --disable-web-security`) (ðŸ”´ temporary hack until cors properly supported)
-   visit http://127.0.0.1:5173/

---

# Goals:

-   type-safety everywhere
-   best-in-class editor support both for `generated SDK` and within the `standalone IDE`.

---

## Comfy Wishlist

-   [ ] `store` node for persistng node output across flow evaluation
-   [ ] `promptID` that can be sent to the server to be included in every `'status'` , `'progress'` , `'executing'` & `'executed'` update payloads

## Concepts:

main front classes

-   ComfyIDEState
    -   ComfyManager
    -   ComfyProject[]
        -   ComfyScript..
            -   code
            -   versions[]

## main scripts

```sh
yarn sync # update ./src/core/ComfySpec.json from server
yarn lib # generate a type-safe library from the spec fetched
yarn dev # start the UI dev-server
```

---

## initial setup

needed:

-   node: js runtime
-   yarn: package manager
-   nvm: node version manager

```sh
# install all dependencies
yarn install
```

## Current TODOs:

-   [ ] write some more TODOs
