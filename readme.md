## Installation

-   install https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI
-   download some models so you have a functional Comfy setup (see [this](scripts/download-models.sh))
-   start the server `python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0`
-   start the client `yarn dev`
-   open a web-browser with CORS disabled (e.g. `google-chrome --disable-web-security`) (ðŸ”´ temporary hack until cors properly supported)
-   visit http://127.0.0.1:5173/

---

# Goals:

-   type-safety everywhere
-   best-in-class editor support both for `generated SDK` and within the `standalone IDE`.

---

## Comfy Wishlist

-   [ ] `store` node for persistng node output across flow evaluation
-   [ ] `promptID` that can be sent to the server to be included in every `'status'` , `'progress'` , `'executing'` & `'executed'` update payloads
